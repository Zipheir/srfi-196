<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Ranges are collections somewhat similar to vectors, except that
  they are immutable and have algorithmic representations instead of
  the uniform per-element data structure of vectors. The storage required is
  usually less than the size of the same collection stored in a
  vector and the time needed to reference a particular element is
  typically less for a range than for the same collection stored in a
  list. This SRFI defines a large subset of the sequence operations
  defined on lists, vectors, strings, and other collections.  If
  necessary, a range can be converted to a list, vector, or string of
  its elements or a generator that will lazily produce each element in
  the range.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

None at present.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>One of the most common things to do in programming is to execute
a block of code a fixed number of times, with access to the index
used for the iteration.  Indeed, it is so common that there is generally
a standard syntax for providing it, generally involving the keyword
<code>for</code> (or if not, as in Fortran and Lisp, the word
<code>do</code>).  It is also usual to be able to provide a lower bound,
(generally defaulting to 0 or 1) as well as a step (generally
defaulting to 1) which allows iterations through a sequence of odd
numbers, or multiples of 10, or whatever.</p>

<p>Languages with higher order functions, however, provide a second
approach to such loops: construct a sequence of numbers and apply
a function to each element of the sequence.  SRFI 1's <code>iota</code>
and the standard <code>for-each</code> procedures make this easy:
<code>(for-each (lambda (i) ...) (iota 0 10))</code>
will execute the expressions represented as <code>...</code>
with <code>i</code> bound to the numbers 0 through 9, as
the generated list includes the lower bound and excludes the upper bound.</p>

<p>This approach is less feasible as the number of numbers grows.
To iterate a million times involves constructing a list of a million
numbers to be iterated over and immediately discarded as garbage.
This is not something you want to do in the inner loop of your code.
The range objects of this SRFI represent such sequences using (as a rule)
a small fixed amount of storage.  Using
<code>(range-for-each (lambda (i) ...) (numeric-range 0 1000000))</code>
iterates a million times but with less space overhead than
<code>iota</code>'s list of ten elements.
They can be thought of as compactly stored vectors.</p>

<p>In addition, there are other sequences besides integers from
which a range can be drawn.  In particular, inexact numbers can
also specify ranges: <code>(numeric-range 0.0 1.0 0.1)</code>
specifies the sequence 0.0, 0.1, ... 0.9,
at least when inexact numbers are represented
as IEEE 754 binary double floats (as is usually the case).
Roundoff error is still possible when multiplying, but it is
greatly reduced compared to accumulated error by repeated adding.
</p>
<p>Two more examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The basic Latin capital letters A-Z can be specified using
a range constructed by <code>(range 26
(lambda (n) (integer->char (+ 65 n))))</code>.
</li>
<li>
The geometric sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, &hellip;, 1/512 can be expressed by
<code>(range 10 (lambda (n) (expt 1/2 n)))</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>The rationale for <code>string-range</code> is to provide efficient
random access to strings.  There have been many attempts to ensure
O(1) reference to string characters, such as string cursors, UTF-32
encoding, SRFI 135 texts, immutable strings, and so on.  Because
the <code>range-ref</code> procedure for a string created
through <code>string-range</code> runs in O(1) time in the length of
the string, a range created by <code>string-range</code> can
efficiently access arbitrary characters of the range.

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Ranges belong to a disjoint type.</p>

<p>Ranges provide certain running time guarantees.  With each range, we
associate two lengths of time, the <em>average accessing time</em> and
the <em>total accessing time</em>.  The <dfn>total accessing time</dfn>
is the average accessing time multiplied by the length of the range.
In the runtime guarantees below, the time spent
in arguments designated by <var>pred</var>, <var>equal</var>,
or <var>proc</var> is ignored.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise noted, procedures in this SRFI that return
ranges allocate at most O(1) new locations (see R[57]RS section 3.4
for further information).  Such ranges are known as <dfn>compact
ranges</dfn>.  Procedures marked as returning <dfn>expanded
ranges</dfn> allocate at most O(<em>n</em>) locations, where
<em>n</em> is the number of elements in the range.</p>

<p>This SRFI recommends, but does not require, that Scheme implementations
which also provide <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/srfi-42.html">SRFI 42</a>
modify it so that the typed generator <code>:range</code> also accepts
a single argument which is a range in the sense of this SRFI.
This feature should be used with caution, as SRFI 42 loops expect
that <code>:range</code> iterates only over exact rationals.
</p>

<p>The following names are used for arguments to procedures:</p>

<p><em>obj</em>: Any Scheme object.</p>

<p><em>range</em>: A range object.</p>

<p><em>pred</em>: A predicate that accepts zero or more arguments.</p>

<p><em>equal</em>: A predicate that accepts two arguments and returns a
boolean value. It is not necessarily an equivalence relation.</p>

<p><em>length</em>: An exact positive integer.</p>

<p><em>proc</em>: A procedure that accepts zero or more arguments and
returns zero or more values.</p>

<p><em>list</em>: A Scheme list.</p>

<p><em>vector</em>: A Scheme vector.</p>

<p><em>string</em>: A Scheme string.</p>

<p>It is an error (unless otherwise noted) if the procedures are passed
arguments that do not have the type implied by the argument names.</p>

<h3 id="constructors">Constructors</h3>
<p><code>(range</code>&nbsp;<em>length indexer</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a range whose length (number of elements) is <i>length</i>.
The <i>indexer</i> procedure returns the <i>n</i>th element (where 0
&#x2264; <i>n</i> &lt; <i>length</i>) of the range, given <i>n</i>.
This procedure must run in O(1) time.
The range returned is compact, although <em>indexer</em> may close over
arbitrarily large data structures.
The average accessing time of
the resulting range is the average time needed to
run <code><var>indexer</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(numeric-range</code>&nbsp;<em>start end</em> [<em>step</em>]<code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a numeric range, a special case of a range specified by an
inclusive lower bound <em>start</em>, an exclusive upper bound <em>end</em>, and a
<em>step</em> value (default 1), all of which can be exact or inexact real
numbers.  This range produces the sequence</p>
<blockquote>
<em>start</em><code>, (+&nbsp;</code><em>start&nbsp;step</em><code>),
(+&nbsp;</code><em>start</em><code>&nbsp;(* 2 </code><em>step</em><code>)),
&hellip;, (+&nbsp;</code><em>start</em><code>
(*&nbsp;</code><em>n step</em><code>))</code>,
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>n</em> is the greatest integer such that
<code>(+&nbsp;</code><em>start</em><code> (*&nbsp;</code><em>n step</em><code>))</code>
&lt; <em>end</em> if <em>step</em> is positive, or such that
<code>(+&nbsp;</code><em>start</em><code> (*&nbsp;</code><em>n step</em><code>))</code>
&gt; <em>end</em> if <em>step</em> is negative. It is is an error if an
<em>n</em> satisfying this condition cannot be determined, or if
<em>step</em> is numerically zero.  This procedure must run in O(1)
time.  The average accessing time of the resulting range must be O(1).</p>

<p>Note that an effect of this definition is that the elements of a
range over inexact numbers are enumerated by multiplying the index by
the step value rather than by adding the step value to itself
repeatedly.  This reduces the likelihood of roundoff errors.</p>

<p><code>(vector-range</code>&nbsp;<em>vector</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns an expanded range whose elements are those of <em>vector</em>.  The
procedure must run in O(1) time.
The average accessing time of the
resulting range must be O(1).  It is an error to
mutate <em>vector</em>.</p>

<p><code>(string-range</code> <em>string</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a range whose elements are those of <em>string</em>.  It is
an error to mutate <em>string</em>.  This procedure must run in
O(<em>n</em>) time, where <em>n</em> is the length of <em>string</em>.
The average accessing time of the
resulting range must be O(1).</p>
<p>In a Scheme that guarantees O(1) random
access to strings,
<code>range-ref</code> on a range created by <code>string-range</code>
can simply call <code>string-ref</code>, and the resulting range is compact.
But if only O(<em>n</em>)
access is available, this procedure may 
have to copy the string's characters into a vector,
resulting in an expanded range.</p>

<p><code>(range-append</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a range whose elements are the elements of
the <em>ranges</em> in order.  This procedure must run in
O(<em>n</em>) + O(<var>k</var>) time, where <em>n</em> is the total
number of elements in all the ranges and <var>k</var> is the number of
ranges.  The result is usually expanded but may be compact.  The average
accessing time of the resulting range is asymptotically bounded by
maximum of the average accessing times of the <var>ranges</var>.
</p>

<h3 id="predicates">Predicates</h3>

<p><code>(range?</code>&nbsp;<em>obj</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <em>obj</em> is a range and <code>#f</code>
otherwise.
This procedure must run in O(1) time.</p>

<p><code>(range=?</code>&nbsp;<em>equal range1 range2 ...</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if all the <em>ranges</em> are of the same
length and if their corresponding values are the same in the sense of
<em>equal</em>, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
The runtime of this procedure is O(<em>s</em>) + O(<em>k</em>),
where <em>s</em> is the sum of the total accessing times of the
<var>ranges</var> and <em>k</em> is the number of <var>ranges</var>.</p>
<h3 id="accessors">Accessors</h3>

<p><code>(range-length</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns the length (number of elements) of <em>range</em>.
This procedure must run in O(1) time.</p>

<p><code>(range-ref</code>&nbsp;<em>range n</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns the <em>n</em>th element of <em>range</em>. It is an error if
<em>n</em> is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of
<em>range</em>.  The running time of this procedure must be
asymptotically equal to the average accessing time
of <code><var>range</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-first</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Equivalent (in running time as well)
to <code>(range-ref</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em> 0)<code></code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-last</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Equivalent (in running time as well)
to <code>(range-ref</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em> <code>(-
(range-length</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>) 1))</code>.</p>

<h3 id="iteration">Iteration</h3>

<p><code>(range-split-at</code>&nbsp;<em>range index</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns two values:
<code>(range-take</code>&nbsp;<em>range index</em><code>)</code> and
<code>(range-drop</code>&nbsp;<em>range index</em><code>)</code>.
It is an error if <em>index</em> is not an exact integer
between 0 and the length of <em>range</em>, both inclusive.
This procedure must run in O(1) time.</p>
<p><code>(subrange</code>&nbsp;<em>range start end</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a range which contains the elements of
<i>range</i> from index <i>start</i>, inclusive, through index
<i>end</i>, exclusive.  This procedure must run in O(1) time.
The average accessing time of the
resulting range is asymptotically bounded by the average accessing
time of <code><var>range</var></code>.</p>
<p><code>(range-segment</code>&nbsp;<em>range length</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a list of ranges representing the consecutive subranges of
length <em>length</em>.  The last range is allowed to be shorter
than <em>length</em>. The procedure must run in O(<em>k</em>) time,
where <em>k</em> is the number of ranges returned.
The average accessing time of the ranges is asymptotically bounded
by the average accessing time of <code><var>range</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-take</code>&nbsp;<em>range count</em><code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-take-right</code>&nbsp;<em>range count</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a range which contains the first/last <em>count</em> elements of
<em>range</em>.

average accessing time of the resulting ranges is
asymptotically bounded by the average accessing time
of <code><var>range</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-drop</code>&nbsp;<em>range count</em><code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-drop-right</code>&nbsp;<em>range count</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a range which contains all except the first/last <em>count</em> elements
of <em>range</em>.
These procedures must run in O(1) time.
The average accessing time of the resulting ranges is
asymptotically bounded by the average accessing time
respectively of <code><var>range</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-count</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Applies <em>pred</em> element-wise to the elements of
<em>ranges</em> and returns the number of applications which returned
true values. If more than one <em>range</em> is given and not all
ranges have the same length, <em>range-count</em> terminates when the
shortest range is exhausted.  The runtime of this procedure is
O(<em>s</em>) where <em>s</em> is the sum of the total accessing times
of the <code><var>ranges</var></code>.</p>
<p><code>(range-any</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Applies <em>pred</em> element-wise to the elements of the
<em>ranges</em> and returns true if <em>pred</em> returns true on any
application. Specifically it returns the last value returned by
<em>pred</em>. Otherwise, <code>#f</code> is returned. If more than
one <em>range</em> is given and not all ranges have the same length,
<em>range-any</em> terminates when the shortest range is exhausted.
The runtime of this procedure is O(<em>s</em>) where <em>s</em> is the
sum of the total accessing times of
the <code><var>ranges</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-every</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Applies <em>pred</em> element-wise to the elements of the
<em>ranges</em> and returns true if <em>pred</em> returns true on
every application. Specifically it returns the last value returned by
<em>pred</em>, or <code>#t</code> if <em>pred</em> was never invoked.
Otherwise, <code>#f</code> is returned. If more than one
<em>range</em> is given and not all ranges have the same length,
<em>range-every</em> terminates when the shortest range is exhausted.
The runtime of this procedure is O(<em>s</em>) + O(<em>k</em>),
where <em>s</em> is the sum of the total accessing times of the
<var>ranges</var> and <em>k</em> is the number of <var>ranges</var>.</p>

<p><code>(range-map</code>&nbsp;<em>proc range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-map-&gt;list</code>&nbsp;<em>proc range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-map-&gt;vector</code>&nbsp;<em>proc range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Applies <em>proc</em> element-wise to the elements of the
<em>ranges</em> and returns a range/list/vector of the results, in
order. If more than one <em>range</em> is given and not all ranges
have the same length, these procedures terminate when the shortest
range is exhausted. The dynamic order in which <em>proc</em> is
actually applied to the elements is unspecified.  The runtime of these
procedures is O(<em>s</em>) where <em>s</em> is the sum of the total
accessing times of the <code><var>ranges</var></code>.
The <code>range-map</code> procedure eagerly computes its result
and returns an expanded range.
Its average accessing time is O(1).</p>

<p><code>(range-for-each</code>&nbsp;<em>proc range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Applies <em>proc</em> element-wise to the elements of the
<code>ranges</code> in order. Returns an unspecified result. If more
than one <em>range</em> is given and not all ranges have the same
length, <em>range-for-each</em> terminates when the shortest range is
exhausted.  The runtime of this procedure is O(<em>s</em>)
where <em>s</em> is the sum of the total accessing times of
the <code><var>ranges</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-filter-map</code> <em>proc range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-filter-map-&gt;list</code> <em>proc range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Applies <em>proc</em> element-wise to the elements of
the <em>ranges</em> and returns a range/list of the true values
returned by <em>proc</em>.  If more than one <em>range</em> is given
and not all ranges have the same length, these procedures terminate
when the shortest range is exhausted. The dynamic order in
which <em>proc</em> is actually applied to the elements is unspecified.
The <code>range-filter-map</code> procedure eagerly computes its result
and returns an expanded range.
The runtime of these procedures is O(<em>n</em>)
where <em>n</em> is the sum of the total accessing times of
the <code><var>ranges</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-filter</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range</em><code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-filter-&gt;list</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range</em><code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-remove</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range</em><code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-remove-&gt;list</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range</em><code>)</code><br/>
<p>Returns a range/list containing the elements of <em>range</em> that
satisfy / do not satisfy <em>pred</em>.  The runtime of these
procedures is O(<em>s</em>) where <em>s</em> is the sum of the total
accessing times of the <code><var>ranges</var></code>.</p>

<p>The <code>range-filter</code> and <code>range-remove</code>
procedures eagerly compute their results and return expanded ranges.
Their average accessing time is O(1).</p>

<p><code>(range-fold</code>&nbsp;<em>kons nil range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-fold-right</code>&nbsp;<em>kons nil range1 range2</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Folds <em>kons</em> over the elements of <em>ranges</em> in order / reverse order.
<em>kons</em> is applied as
<code>(</code><em>kons state</em> <code>(range-ref</code> <em>range1
i</em><code>)</code> <code>(range-ref</code> <em>range2
i</em><code>)</code> &hellip;<code>)</code> where <em>state</em> is
the result of the previous invocation and <em>i</em> is the current
index. For the first invocation, <em>nil</em> is used as the first
argument. Returns the result of the last invocation, or <em>nil</em>
if there was no invocation.  If more than one <em>range</em> is given
and not all ranges have the same length, these procedures terminate
when the shortest range is exhausted.  The runtime of these procedures
must be O(<em>s</em>) where <em>s</em> is the sum of the total
accessing times of the <code><var>ranges</var></code>.</p>

<h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>

<p><code>(range-index</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range1 range2</em>... <code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-index-right</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range1 range2</em>... <code>)</code></p>
<p>Applies <em>pred</em> element-wise to the elements of
<em>ranges</em> and returns the index of the first/last element at
which <em>pred</em> returns true. Otherwise, returns <code>#f</code>.
If more than one <em>range</em> is given and not all ranges have the same
length, <em>range-index</em> terminates when the shortest range is
exhausted. It is an error if the ranges passed to <em>range-index-right</em>
do not all have the same lengths.  The runtime of these procedures
must be O(<em>s</em>) where <em>s</em> is the sum of the total accessing times of
the <code><var>ranges</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-take-while</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range</em><code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-take-while-right</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a range containing the leading/trailing elements of <em>range</em> that satisfy
<em>pred</em> up to the first/last one that does not.  The runtime of
these procedures is asymptotically bounded by the total accessing time
of the <code><var>range</var></code>.
The average accessing time of the resulting range is O(1).</p>

<p><code>(range-drop-while pred</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-drop-while-right</code>&nbsp;<em>pred range</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a range that omits leading/trailing elements of <em>range</em> that satisfy
<em>pred</em> until the first/last one that does not.  The runtime of
these procedures is asymptotically bounded by the total accessing time
of the <code><var>range</var></code>.
The average accessing time of the resulting range is O(1).</p>

<h3 id="conversion">Conversion</h3>

<p><code>(range-&gt;list</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-&gt;vector</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code><br/>
<code>(range-&gt;string</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a list/vector/string containing the elements
of <em>range</em> in order.  It is an error to modify the result
of <code>range-&gt;vector</code> or of <code>range-&gt;string</code>.
In the case of <code>range-&gt;string</code>, it is an error if any
element of <em>range</em> is not a character.  The running times of
these procedures is O(<em>s</em>) where <em>s</em> is the total
accessing time for <code><var>range</var></code>.</p>

<p><code>(vector-&gt;range</code> <em>vector</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns an expanded range whose elements are those of <em>vector</em>.
Note that, unlike <code>vector-range</code>, it is not
an error to mutate <em>vector</em>; future mutations of
<em>vector</em> are guaranteed not to affect the range returned by
<code>vector-&gt;range</code>.  This procedure must run in O(<em>n</em>)
where <em>n</em> is the length of <code><var>vector</var></code>.
Otherwise, this procedure is equivalent
to <code>vector-range</code>.</p>

<p><code>(range-&gt;generator</code>&nbsp;<em>range</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Returns a SRFI 158 generator that generates the elements
of <em>range</em> in order.  This procedure must run in O(1) time, and
the running time of each call of the generator is asymptotically
bounded by the average accessing time of <code><var>range</var></code>.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The sample implementation is in the repository of this SRFI.
An R7RS library file and a separate file containing the actual
implementation are provided, along with a test file that
works with SRFI 78, but is self-contained if SRFI 78 does not exist.
The implementation uses SRFI 1 and can take
advantage of SRFI 145 (<code>assume</code>) if it is present.</p>
